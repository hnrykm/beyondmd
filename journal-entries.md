Today, I worked on... - Understanding the three prompts, making notes, and writing down stretch goals - Began researching and reading documentation for "react-pdf" and Material UI - Explored free medical API service options - Started GitHub repository, installed React.js and Django, and directory structure - Created Dockerfiles for Django and PostgreSQL - Created docker-compose.yml for react, django, postgres, and pg-admin

Today, I overcame these struggles... - Getting React Docker image built and running. I added a "run.sh" file with commands to install and start npm to fix the exiting Docker container with Error 127. - Getting Django Docker image built and running. I reconfigured the directory structure to remove errors, added psycopg2 dependency to requirements.txt, and changed default SQLite database settings to PostgreSQL. - Getting the pg-admin to function with the correct username/password. I used the same "pg-admin" name for the volume on another project so I renamed it "pg-admin-bmd".

Today's blockers are... - Django Docker container is running with error: Connection refused Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432.

Notes:
For past bootcamp projects, I've used React/Django with SQLite and though we learned the basics of Dockerfiles, Docker commands, and docker-compose. It was a new experience to create the files, commands, and docker-compose.yml file. Gained more familiarity and everything is running but the Django-PostgreSQL isn't fully configured/functional at the moment. Lots of ideas floating around for how I can demonstrate my ability to go over and beyond.
